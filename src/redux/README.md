This folder contain basic duck structure, based on scalability and maintainability  [architecture](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/structure-your-react-redux-project-for-scalability-and-maintainability-618ad82e32b7).

Here is base duck pattern realisation:
* [types](theme/types.js) contains string literals for action types.
* [actions](theme/actions.js) contains all action creators definitions.
* [reducers](theme/reducer.js) maintain updating the state.
